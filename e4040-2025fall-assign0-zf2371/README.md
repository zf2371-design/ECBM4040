# Assignment 0

## Distributed in Github Repository e4040-2025fall-assign0

The assignment is distributed as a Jupyter Notebook `Assignment 0.ipynb` from a Github repository and/or via Courseworks. Additional instructions and support materials for the assignment can be found in file `README.md` which comes with the assignment. The assignment uses TensorFlow version 2.4.

The simplest way to initially see the content of the Jupyter Notebook file `Assignment 0.ipynb` is to use Google Colab in the cloud: 

1. Use your UNI@columbia.edu account to log into Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)
2. Upload `Assignment 0.ipynb`, explore and run the file. 

<span style="color:red"><strong>TODO:</strong></span> Students should execute the Assignment 0 as soon as possible in Google Colab, before the add/drop.

<span style="color:red"><strong>TODO:</strong></span> For students who are formally registered into this class after the end of the add/drop, the assignment requires that students (for the second time, after Colab) complete the tasks from this Jupyter Notebook by running it on the **Google Cloud (GCP) VM instance** (not Colab, as Colab is only a temporary execution method before the class roster is finalized).

### Detailed instructions on how to submit your solution to this assignment/homework, after add/drop, for fully registered students:

1. The assignment will be distributed (for the second time, after add/drop) as a Github classroom assignment - as a special repository accessed through a link
2. Student's copy of the assignment gets created automatically with a special name - <span style="color:red"><strong>students must rename their repo according to the instructions below</strong></span>
3. The solution to the assignment must be pushed into your repository
4. Three files/screenshots need to be uploaded into the directory `figures/` of your repository which prove that the assignment has been completed in the cloud
5. Submit your final repository through Gradescope

### Screenshots for illustrating/documenting that the assignment was completed in the Google Cloud:

In folder `figures/`, the instructors provide 3 screenshots as examples demonstrating the completion of the assignment in Google Cloud:
1. A screenshot showing that a VM instance is running under the project **ecbm-UNI**.
2. A screenshot showing that a Jupyter Notebook is running in the instance under **`envTF24`**.
3. A screenshot showing the `Assignment 0.ipynb` file, with the **IP address** on top of the browser.

Students must upload three similar screenshots in the same directory, but with the modified names - add UNI in front of the file names:
1. UNI_gcp_work_example_screenshot_1.png
2. UNI_gcp_work_example_screenshot_2.png
3. UNI_gcp_work_example_screenshot_3.png

### <span style="color:red"><strong>TODO:</strong></span> (Re)naming of the student repository

***INSTRUCTIONS*** for naming the student's repository for assignments (with one student):
* Students need to use the following name for the repository with their solutions: `e4040-2025fall-assign0-UNI` (the first part "e4040-2025fall-assign0" will be inherited from the assignment repository, so only UNI needs to be changed) 
* Initially, the system may give the repository a name which ends with a student's Github user ID. The student should change that name and replace it with the name requested in the point above
  * Good Example: `e4040-2025fall-assign0-zz9999`
  * Bad example: `e4040-2025fall-assign0-e4040-2025fall-assign0-zz9999`
* This change can be done from the "Settings" tab which is located on the repository page.

***INSTRUCTIONS*** for naming the students' solution repository for assignments with more students, such as the final project (students need to use a 4-letter groupID):
* Template: `e4040-2025fall-Project-GroupID-UNI1-UNI2-UNI3`
* Example: `e4040-2025fall-Project-MEME-zz9999-aa9999-aa0000`
